It’s easy to get caught up in the chaos. Headlines scream about disaster, your phone buzzes with negativity, and the world feels like it’s spiraling out of control. You live the apocalypse every day, or at least it feels that way. And to the person who sees the world as more negative than positive, I get it. I’ve been there.

In those moments, it feels safe to expect the worst, like we’re protecting ourselves from disappointment or hurt. It becomes second nature—our mind’s way of shielding us from the scary things we hear about daily. But over time, these small “protections” build up, leaving us trapped in a world that feels overwhelming and, yes, apocalyptic.

It can seem impossible to break free from this, but one of the few things in life we can change is our perspective. And I can tell you firsthand: changing how you see the world can completely transform your experience in it.

## Everything in Life Has Good and Bad—It’s All in How You See It

Good and bad are rarely as clear-cut as we think. They’re often just words shaped by our context. Take a half-filled glass of water. Someone who’s just been out for a run and is parched might see that glass as half-full, while someone who expected a full glass might view it as half-empty. The glass itself doesn’t change; it’s the circumstances and mindset of the person that do.

This idea applies to almost everything in life. We encounter so many events, large and small, that we label as "good" or "bad." But these labels are fluid, often depending on how we’re feeling at the time or the outlook we carry into a situation. And while it might feel instinctual to focus on the negative, shifting that focus toward the positive—even just a little—can open us up to a completely different world.

## How to Accomplish the Impossible

It’s easier to see the world as scary. It’s ingrained in us, a byproduct of evolution. We’re hardwired to focus on danger, but that doesn’t mean we’re powerless to change it. Shifting our perspective toward intentional positivity is difficult—but it's absolutely necessary. Anything worth doing tends to be difficult at first. But the beauty of hard things is that they become easier with practice.

Fauja Singh once said, “Anything worth doing is going to be difficult.” And I’ve found this to be true. By consciously building habits of gratitude, appreciation, and positivity, what once seemed impossible starts to feel more natural. As Thomas Fuller put it, "All things are difficult before they are easy."

In short, changing your perspective might seem intimidating or even unrealistic in today’s world. But the secret lies in starting small. Instead of focusing on the world’s big, overwhelming problems, look for hope in the little things: a kind gesture, a peaceful moment, a small victory. No matter how difficult things seem, if you’re reading this, you’ve already made it through the worst thing you’ve ever experienced—and you can make it through whatever comes next.

## Start by Counting the Small Blessings

In my experience, the shift from negativity to positivity didn’t happen overnight. It’s a journey, a practice of counting the small blessings in life, even when it feels like everything’s falling apart. When I started to intentionally focus on the positives, I noticed that my relationships, creativity, and overall sense of peace improved. I started to feel more resilient and less weighed down by the endless stream of bad news.

At ILYTAT Designs, we embrace a mindset of intentional positivity. Having gone through our own versions of dark days, we know how important it is to find moments of joy and light in our lives. Those experiences have shaped our understanding of happiness and resilience.

Our journey has shown us that even during tough times, there are always small sparks of hope to be found. It’s these moments that inspire us to spread positivity and create a sense of calm amidst the chaos.

The idea behind ILYTAT was born out of a desire to share that positivity with others. We believe that even simple reminders of beauty and joy can make a difference in someone’s day. It’s about fostering connections and encouraging one another to seek out the good, no matter the circumstances.

In a world that often feels heavy, we hope to inspire others to look for those glimmers of hope and to cultivate a more positive outlook on life.

You don’t have to live the apocalypse every day. Changing your perspective may be tough, but it’s one of the most empowering choices you can make. And once you start seeing the world through a more hopeful lens, you’ll notice the world changing in return.
